Machine Learning Project

Project Description

Dataset : AudioMNIST is the dataset used to create the features. Check this link for further
details about the dataset [Link](https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST).

Layer-9 and Layer-10 were modeled and trained to classify the following four labels.
1. Speaker ID
2. Speaker Age
3. Speaker Gender
4. Speaker Accent

This git repository contains two directories each for Layer-9 and Layer-10. Each directory contains jupyter notebooks as well as the python script for classification of
each label.
Techniques used for the classifier model
1. Feature scaling
2. SMOTE feature sampling
3. PCA dimensionality reduction
4. SVM classification
5. Grid search hyperparameter optimization
6. Stratified cross-validation
